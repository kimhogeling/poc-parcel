# Proof of Concept for Parcel
Parcel is an alternative for Webpack and it claims to have zero configuration.
It has grown in popularity, so about time I try it out!

## Setup
```bash
$ npm i
```

## Run dev server
```bash
$ npm run dev 
```

## Build for production
```bash
$ npm run build 
```

## Babel
When installing further babel plugins, register them in the `.babelrc` file.
